# Football Manager 24 Analysis 
So following the conclusion of the 2023/2024 season and Jurgen Klopp's final season at Liverpool Football Club I thought why not create a project that simulates life after Klopp and whether I would be a suitable replacement for the outgoing manager. What better way to test my managerial skills than starting a new save on the popular game Football Manager 24 (FM24).  
In this new project I will resume the duties as Liverpool FC, due to the limitations in the game I'll be starting my managerial career in the 2023/2024 season.  
Following each season I'll analyse player data collated throughout the season and analyse areas of weakness in the squad to make informed decisions on players to Sell/Release and which areas of the pitch that require strengthening.  
In the first season of this save I will not be making any transfers in or out to try and capture the realism of the 23/24 season that has already concluded. This however, will only be possible for Liverpool FC transfers as the game will simulate all the other clubs in the world and whereby they will continue to make transfers in the January transfer window of the first season. Injuries in the first season will also not be able to refleft the real life senarios that played out in real life.  
FM allows you to copy and paste squad data from the "Squad" screen where you can specify the columns to be included. The copied columns can then be pasted into either a text file, html file or printed outright. In this project we will save all the data into a .html file and utilise Pandas and bs4 to parse the .html file into a usable dataframe to perform data analysis. The data collected includes 75 different statistics metrics that can all be used to make informed decisions on which players to keep the following season. (Each of the abbreviations will be described in a seperate file soon).  
Each of the players individual attributes will also be saved into a html file to conduct analysis on judging the ability of the current squad and new players to scout and sign. 
At the start of each of the season sections below I'll briefly summarise the team performance in all competition, important results that occured within the season, what formations were used - how successful they were, as well as what formations we were weak against. (This information can be found in the data tab within the game, I will try to include snapshots of each of these.)  
## Season 23/24
### Formation
For this save I decided to choose a 4-2-3-1 (2DM) formation taking inspiration from the Liverpool squad back in 08/09 season when the red's were managed by Rafa Benitez, with some minor modifications to the system. Rafa tended to use a more attacking left full back and a defensive right back. In this system to utilise the ability of Trent Alexander-Arnold I decided to utilise two attacking full backs, to balance the change in the right hand side of the pitch, I made the right sided Centre Defensive a more defensive role to allow Trent to roam forward.  ![4-2-3-1 (2DM) Used for the 2023/2024 Season!](images/starting_formation.PNG)
### January Transfer Window 
At the start of the January transfer window after pulling a 7 point gap at the top of the Premier League, the key objective of this window was to improve the squad depth within the midfield. A injury ravaged first 6 months where at one point there were 8 first team players unavailable, reinforcements were desperately needed.
#### Paulo Dybala
After scouting Europe Paulo Dybala popped up on the radar, the 30 Year old had a release clause of £10.5m which seems like a bargin price for todays market. This signing had very little analysis behind and was purely decided on by the price tag of the player. In terms of how he fits into the squad he would be utilised as a squad player who could slit into the number 10 position (AMC) or as a deputy striker. A good option to have as the first 6 months of this save has been ravaged by injuries across the squad. 
#### Xaver Schlager 
A 26 Year-old Defensive Midfielder, similar to Dybala, Schlager had little analysis into the decision to bring him to the club other than he also had a relatively low release clause. For Schlager his release clause was £30m, which again is a bargin for the age and the ability of the player. In terms of how he fits into the system, he would likely slot into the left of the two defensive midfielders alongside Mac Allister, meaning that unfortunately Endo will have to take up a squad role going forward.  
### Season Summary
A quadruple! We finished the first season winning every trophy available. In the Premier League we won the title with one game to spare, after crafting a 10 point lead by the end of January, a rocky Febuary with one defeat and two draws allowed the nearby teams to catch up.
